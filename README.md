## About Me 🧑🌏

- 🎓 **Master's in Computational Linguistics**: My academic journey has led me to explore the intricacies of language processing, and I'm always excited to apply my knowledge in practical applications.
- 🐍 **Python Lover**: Python is my go-to language for most of my projects due to its versatility and ease of use. Whether it's data analysis, or NLP tasks, Python is my trusty companion.
- 💻 **Web Development Enthusiast**: I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the essential trio of web development languages. Crafting beautiful and functional user interfaces is something that truly excites me.
- 🌐 **Multicultural Background**: Originally from China, my educational journey took me to the UK and Germany, where I've had the opportunity to embrace diverse cultures and perspectives.

## Interests Beyond Code 🌈

While coding keeps me engaged, I believe in finding a balance in life. During my free time, you can often find me embarking on exciting adventures through travel or enjoying the thrill of sports. Embracing creativity in all aspects of life is my mantra!
